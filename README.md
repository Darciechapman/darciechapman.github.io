Code Refractor 

In this project I attempted to simplify existing, functional code into more of an effective layout. I first started on the smaller sections, ie the footer and the heading of the website. Then worked my way up to the larger sections. I experimented with elements, tags and rearranging the code to maximum efficiently.
